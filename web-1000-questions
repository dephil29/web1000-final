1. What are the four steps of mergesort?
	1. split in half
	2. sort one half
	3. sort the other half
	4. merge and repeat...


2. Using JavaScript, generate a random number between 50 and 100.

	Math.random() * 50 + 50;

3. Using Javascript, generate a random number between -100 and 100.

	Math.random() * -200 + 100;

4. Write a coin flip function. It should return the string "heads"
   half the time and the string "tails" the other half

	function coinFlip(){

	    return (Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) == 0) ? 'heads' : 'tails';

	}

	coinFlip();

5. Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(10 > x)

	 (10 <= x)

6. Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(a > 10 && b <= 5)

	 (a <= 10 && b > 5)

7. Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(!isLegal || !isFelony)

	 (isLegal || isFelony)

11. What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions?

    the scope is an argument that contains the html that will be presented by the expression.

14. For exercises 9 and 10, if you assume that n is the size of one side of the matrix,
what is the time complexity (Big Oh) of the algorithms you wrote?

      O(n);
